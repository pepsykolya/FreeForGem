# FreeForGemPear

GPU miner for **Pearl (PRL)** — pearlhash proof-of-useful-work — with a **1% developer fee**.

Our own CUDA kernel for NVIDIA Ampere: the A′ matrix is generated on-chip, the int8 tensor-core
GEMM (`mma.sync m16n8k32`) runs in a persistent kernel, and the jackpot fold and the BLAKE3
hash are fused into it. The main loop is hand-tuned at SASS level. The host builds and checks
every share proof with the official `zk-pow` verifier before it is submitted.

## Performance

RTX 3070 locked at 1560 MHz core / 810 MHz memory, LuckyPool, 5-minute run:

| | Hashrate | Power |
|---|---|---|
| FreeForGemPear 1.4.6 | 70.5 TH/s | ~107 W (optional `--auto-uv`: see below) |
| FreeForGemPear 1.4.5 | 70.2 TH/s | ~107 W |
| FreeForGemPear 1.3.1 | 70.2 TH/s | ~107 W |
| FreeForGemPear 1.3.0 | 70.2 TH/s | ~107 W |
| FreeForGemPear 1.2.0 | 69.1 TH/s | ~107 W |
| FreeForGemPear 1.1.0 | 68.3 TH/s | ~114 W |
| FreeForGemPear 1.0.0 | 65.6 TH/s | ~105 W |

Kernel bench (1.3.0, k = 8192): 69.5 TMAC/s, 94.6% of the card's int8 tensor peak at 1560 MHz. The main loop
is emitted directly as SASS by our own generator.

## Supported hardware

* **Tuned for:** RTX 30xx (Ampere, sm_86) — 3060 / 3060 Ti / 3070 / 3070 Ti / 3080 / 3090.
* **Should run untuned:** RTX 40xx (sm_89 runs sm_86 code), not tested yet.
* **RTX 50xx (Blackwell, sm_120):** supported since 1.5.0 with a compiled kernel (untuned), needs NVIDIA driver 570+.
* **Not supported:** older GPUs, A100 (sm_80), AMD.
* **System:** Linux x86_64 or Windows 10/11 x64, NVIDIA driver 525 or newer (RTX 50xx: 570 or newer). The Linux binary is built on
  Ubuntu 20.04 (glibc 2.31), so it runs on Ubuntu 20.04+ and HiveOS.

## Usage

```
tar xzf freeforgempear-1.5.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
cd freeforgempear-1.5.0
./freeforgempear --self-test                      # optional: checks the GPU kernel against the CPU reference
./freeforgempear --pool pearl-eu2.luckypool.io:3360 --wallet YOUR_PRL_ADDRESS --worker rig1
```

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--pool HOST:PORT` | stratum pool (default `pearl-eu2.luckypool.io:3360`) |
| `--wallet ADDRESS` | your PRL address (required) |
| `--worker NAME` | worker name (default `worker1`) |
| `--password TEXT` | stratum password (default `x`); on Kryptex `d=VALUE` sets a custom share difficulty |
| `--devices 0,1,...` | GPUs to use (default: all visible; honours `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`) |
| `--minutes N` | stop after N minutes (default: run until Ctrl-C / SIGTERM) |
| `--self-test` | verify the kernel and exit |
| `--auto-uv` | optional (off by default): find, apply and supervise a safe undervolt of the GPU (V/F offset), needs root/Administrator, restores your settings on exit; see [MANUAL.md](MANUAL.md) section 12 |
| `--uv-offset N` / `--uv-reset` | apply a fixed undervolt offset after a check / forget the saved undervolt results |

The miner reconnects to the pool on its own. Every 10 s it logs the hashrate per GPU and in total,
plus the submitted, accepted and rejected shares.

**Tuning.** For best efficiency on a 3070, lock the core clock (for example
`nvidia-smi -lgc 1560,1560`) and lower the memory clock (`nvidia-smi -lmc 810,810`). The kernel
works from L2 cache and barely uses VRAM bandwidth. At 1560 MHz a 3070 draws ~107 W. With the optional `--auto-uv` (new in 1.4.0) the miner also finds the lowest safe core voltage
of each GPU, checking every step bit-for-bit on the GPU and on the CPU, and restores your settings on exit
(roughly 5-10 W less per card at the same hashrate). The default rows-per-attempt `m` is auto-picked per GPU
from its SM count (RTX 3070 &rarr; 47104; +0.4% at the same power), so a mixed-SM rig balances each card
(since 1.4.7); override with `FFGP_M`.

**CPU.** The host needs well under 10% of one CPU core per GPU (GPU waits sleep instead of spinning), so
multi-GPU rigs with older CPUs run at full speed.

## Windows

Download `freeforgempear-1.5.0-windows-x64.zip`, unpack it to a folder without spaces, pick the ready start file for your pool
(`start-luckypool-eu/ru/us/asia.bat`, `start-kryptex-eu/ru/us/asia.bat`; `start.bat` = LuckyPool Europe), replace the example
`WALLET` (the developer's address) with your own and run it. Output goes to the window and to `logs\`; a miner that
exits is restarted after 15 s. Only the NVIDIA driver is needed. Details: [MANUAL.md](MANUAL.md#5-windows-1011),
`README-WINDOWS.txt`.

## HiveOS

FreeForGemPear runs on HiveOS as a Custom miner. Set the flight sheet *Miner* to *Custom* and use
this *Installation URL*:

```
https://github.com/pepsykolya/FreeForGemPear/releases/download/v1.5.0/freeforgempear-1.5.0.tar.gz
```

Wallet template `%WAL%.%WORKER_NAME%`, pool URL `pearl-eu2.luckypool.io:3360`.

**NOCK merge mining (LuckyPool).** Use `prl1...+YOUR_NOCK_ADDRESS` as the wallet and LuckyPool pays NOCK for the same work,
with no hashrate loss (Linux, Windows `.bat` and HiveOS alike; on other pools the miner drops the `+NOCK` part by itself). The step-by-step guide,
in English and Russian, with overclock settings is in **[HIVEOS.md](HIVEOS.md)**.

## Developer fee

1% of the mining time: one 60-second slot in every 100 minutes, at a random moment of the cycle,
on **the same pool you configured**, under a separate login (worker `ffgp-devfee`; on LuckyPool it also merge-mines NOCK for the developer). The log shows
`devfee: next slot in N min`, `devfee: mining 60s for FreeForGemPear dev (1%)` and
`devfee: back to user`. The first slot comes at a random moment within the first 100 minutes. If the fee login
can't be served, the slot is skipped; your mining is never blocked.

The fee is a condition of the license: removing, reducing or redirecting it is not permitted
(see [LICENSE](LICENSE), clause 3).

## Building from source

The **host program** (pool client, job and proof logic, `host/`) is open source and built from this repository.
The **GPU kernel is closed source**: the search library is provided as a binary in `prebuilt/`
(`linux-x86_64/libpearlgpu.so`, `windows-x64/pearlgpu.dll` + `pearlgpu.lib`). Its C API is declared in
`gpu/pearlgpu.h`. The build only compiles the host and links this library.

Requirements: Rust (stable, edition 2024), a C linker (gcc), git, and the NVIDIA driver (or the CUDA toolkit stubs) so the
linker can resolve the library's `libcuda.so.1` dependency. No `nvcc` is needed.

```
./build.sh          # -> dist/freeforgempear-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz and dist/freeforgempear-<version>.tar.gz (HiveOS)
```

Windows x64 (Visual Studio 2022 or Build Tools with the C++ workload, Rust with the MSVC toolchain, git), in PowerShell:

```
.\build-windows.ps1 # -> dist\freeforgempear-<version>-windows-x64.zip (+ .sha256)
```

It builds `freeforgempear.exe` with a static MSVC runtime (`PEARLGPU_DIR` points `host/build.rs` at the directory with
`pearlgpu.lib`) and packs it with `pearlgpu.dll`. The only runtime dependency is the NVIDIA driver.

Portable Linux build matching the release binaries (needs Docker):

```
docker build -f Dockerfile.build -t ffgp-build .
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/src ffgp-build
```

The library contains only the tuned search kernel; if it can't be loaded (unsupported GPU or too old a driver),
`pg_init` fails with a clear error and the miner reports it.
